# Redux Blog
This repo contains code for a simple blog developed using the react-redux framework. You can create a new post, get posts from a RESTful api, update posts, and delete posts. It supports markdown and in-place editing.

## Challenges
The most difficult part of the lab was understanding the general data flow in the beginning. Once that was accomplished, a lot of the work just lay in debugging. The most challenging bugs came from editing and displaying content in the posts page as well as from just displaying the list of posts correctly the very first time. It still takes a second for edits to appear after you click off. Also you need to write in markdown in order to make the image appear rather than just pasting in the link.
